# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

# What branch we are watching
trigger:
  - 'master'

# the type of VM you are going to use

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

# Watch for PRs
pr: none

# the sequential steps to follow - build, run, test, deploy, etc...
stages: # This stage will build the project
  - stage:
    jobs:
      - job: 'build'
        steps:
          - script: dotnet build 'Proj0/Proj0.sln'
      - job: 'run' # this stage will run the tests
        dependsOn: 'build' # requires that build succeed
        steps:
          - script: dotnet run

# Gives it a unique name 
name: '$(date:yyyMMdd)$(rev:rr)'
